# OpenSource-Fun
This repo will have some documentation I made for the innitial setup of a few neat and free open source services. These services have a lot to offer outside of my innitial set up stuff so check out their documentation.

Services:
- FreePBX Asterisk: VoIP server that is honestly pretty simple to configure and use.
- Citadel: Groupware server like microsoft exchange except a little jank but its pretty alright once you get used to it
- LibreNMS: God tier Network monitoring server. a bit more step intensive to set up but its pretty cool
- Nautobot(coming eventually): Network automation server that by itself is ok but with their useful apps and plugins becomes pretty neato
- Jitsi: A fairly simplistic voice and video conferencing server.
