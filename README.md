# OpenSource-Fun
This repo will have some documentation I made for the innitial setup of a few neat and free open source services. These services have a lot to offer outside of my innitial set up stuff so check out their documentation.

For context: Large scale team project over the course of a semester to set up a solid network that a company could use with many services like wireless, voip, NAS, security, Active Directory, email, etc. I chose to take on our open source suite of tools to show off some cool free services and learn more about setting up servers. 

For our exchange equivelant for email I chose Citadel
For our VoIP I chose FreePBX since I've played with it before
For our network monitoring solution I chose LibreNMS because I had been introduced to it in a work environment at a customer site I was on and I thought it was sick as heck
For our conferencing solution I chose Jitsi due to their ease of set up and because I've used their online conferencing services before for DnD and I thought it was cool.

Nautobot is a project I am working on as of making this repo due to a collaborative sponsorship of my capstone project between Arista and Network to Code. Both sick companies and I'd recommend checking them out

Services:
- FreePBX Asterisk: VoIP server that is honestly pretty simple to configure and use.
- Citadel: Groupware server like microsoft exchange except a little jank but its pretty alright once you get used to it
- LibreNMS: God tier Network monitoring server. a bit more step intensive to set up but its pretty cool
- Nautobot(coming eventually): Network automation server that by itself is ok but with their useful apps and plugins becomes pretty fricken neato
- Jitsi(incomplete cause i lost data but ill get to it eventually): A fairly simplistic voice and video conferencing server.
